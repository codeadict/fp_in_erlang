# Week 1 Notes

## 1.5

* Erlang shell has some nice Emacs shortcuts. Most of them are outlined at https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/504d151a57bc93acb3fb7597214a8e62be9c1cfd/lib/stdlib/src/edlin.erl#L186. MAybe write a blog post about these.

* In the shell one can create anonymous functions(lambdas) like `SumOfTwo = fun(A, B) -> A + B end.` and the evaluate like `SumOfTwo(10, 14).`.

* To forget varaibale bindings in the shell, use `f(VariableName).` or `f().` to forget all.
